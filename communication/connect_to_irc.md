Internet Relay Chat (IRC) despite being an ancient chat protocol, is highly
 used in the JavaScript, Node.js, and general web development community. It's
 __important__ that you're familiar with it and can utilize it for help and to 
 connect with others in the community. We have our own channel to model this 
 community. The channel has two "bots", a logging bot written in Ruby, and a fun
 bot called "codehue" written in NodeJS.
 
  * Connect to the class IRC channel #[codefellows](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23codefellows&uio=d4)
  on freenode.net and say hello.
  * If you want to be able to talk on the ##[javascript](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23javascript&uio=d4)
   channel, you need to register a nickname with Freenode. Type
    `/msg NickServ help` to get started from your IRC client.
  * Mac, best free client is [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/). 
  * Unix, your package manager should have [XChat](http://xchat.org/) or
   [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/). 
  * [http://www.irchelp.org/](http://www.irchelp.org/) is a great intro site if
 you're new to IRC.

There is no submission for this assignment. We'll see you on the #codefellows
channel in class, and on Gitter.IM. They are very useful for sending links to
everyone during class, asking questions in the evening, or just socializing.

We also use [Gitter.IM](https://badges.gitter.im/codefellows/sea-b15-javascript.png) 
as a chatroom just for our class. Click on this button to join.
